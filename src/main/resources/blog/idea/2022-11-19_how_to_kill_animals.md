# How To Kill Animals

Sometimes food that grows on trees are not enough for feeding the villagers, so, killing the animals we encounter can help the villagers
feed on something more tasty. In this example we will use a cow but only animals that are considered enemies will not provide any
meat when killed.

## How animals can be killed?

 * Given a new game with a stack of 1 "Militia" and 1 "Cow" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be a stack with 1 "Militia" and 3 "Meat" cards.
