# ZOMBIE

Zombies are dead villagers. These types of enemies can be found on the dark corners of the mines, so be careful when venturing on the mines.
Be careful on not having protection as zombies can convert villagers on zombies and damage all the progress

## FIND ZOMBIES ON MINES
 
 * Given a new game with 1 stack of 1 "Mine Stroll Idea", 1 "Mine" and 1 "Villager" cards
 * The "Mine Stroll Idea" may create a "Zombie" card.
 * Given that the odds are that we will get a "Zombie" card from the "Mine Stroll Idea" card.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stacks of 1 "Mine Stroll Idea", 1 "Mine", 1 "Villager" and 1 "Zombie" cards
