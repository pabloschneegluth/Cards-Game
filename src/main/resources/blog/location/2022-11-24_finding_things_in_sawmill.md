# Finding things in Sawmill

We can only find wood in the Sawmill, this incredible table will show that:

| $CardName |
|-----------|
| Wood      |

 * Given a new game with a stack of 1 "Sawmill", 1 "Sawmill Stroll Idea" and 1 "Villager" cards.
 * The "Sawmill" may create a "$CardName" card.
 * Given that the odds are that we will get a "$CardName" from the "Sawmill" card.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stacks of 1 "Sawmill", 1 "Sawmill Stroll Idea", 1 "Villager" and 2 "$CardName" cards.
