# Dealer

The dealer is a person that comes and go from the game, and the best of all, is that this card can sell drugs to the other villagers.
If you want to buy something be fast, because dealers disappear at the next moon

## How dealers work

 * Given a new game with a stack of 1 "Villager"
 * End the current moon
 * There should be a new stack with 1 "Dealer"
 * End The current Moon
 * There should be a new stack with 1 "Dealer"
