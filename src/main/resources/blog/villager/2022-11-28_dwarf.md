# Dwarf

Fortunately, villagers can become dwarf soldiers to help protect the village. 
They are stronger characters than the villagers who can fight
against the different dangers without fear of death, and in specific they can kill monsters that 
any more character can, like a troll or a trasgo, due the experience they have in mine.

## How to transform a dwarf

 * Given a new game with a stack of 1 "Villager", 1 "Axe" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stacks of 1 "Dwarf" cards
