# COAL

Coal is used to create campfires, if campfires are not created with coal, the card will not be created and food will not be cooked.
When food is cooked, it is more nutritious and Villagers can spend 1 or more moons without eating.


## HOW TO ACQUIRE COAL IN THE MINE

 * Given a new game with 1 stack of 1 "Mine Stroll Idea", 1 "Mine", 1 "Villager" and 1 "Pickaxe" cards
 * The "Mine Stroll Idea" may create a "Stone" card.
 * Given that the odds are that we will get a "Coal" card from the "Mine Stroll Idea" card.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stacks of 1 "Mine Stroll Idea", 1 "Mine", 1 "Villager", 1 "Pickaxe" and 1 "Coal" cards
