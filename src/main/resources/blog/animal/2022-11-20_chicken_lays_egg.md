# Chicken lays egg

The chicken, like all the chicken does, lays eggs.
Watch out with the chickens, because every day lays
one egg. A lot of eggs will appear if you don't eat
the chicken.

## How a chicken lays an egg
 * Given there are 1 "Chicken" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stacks of 1 "Chicken" and 1 "Egg" cards.
