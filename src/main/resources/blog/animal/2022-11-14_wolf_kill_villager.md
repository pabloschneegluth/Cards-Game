# Wolf Kill Villager!
Be careful! If the wolves come to the village, 
they will show no mercy to the villagers, they will kill them!

# How wolf kills Villager?
Wolves like meat and when it comes to a weak villager, 
they love this prey.

 * Given a new game with a stack of 1 "Wolf" cards and 1 "Villager" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stacks of 1 "Wolf" cards.
