# Ideas

Usually an idea is worthless, unless they are put in practice.
The same happens in this game. 

With the right idea you can transform some cards into other cards.
Transformations take time, often it is one moon. So you will have to
end the moon.

## You have ideas

In addition to your cards, you can find that you have ideas.

### Looking at your ideas

One of the most basic ideas is harvesting, if you enter to the game
you will see it.

 * Given a new example. 
 * Enter the game.
 * There should be the "Harvest Idea" idea.

### Ideas are cards

Well, surprisingly ideas are cards.
Although they are not among your cards:

 * Given a new example.
 * Enter the game.
 * There should be 0 "Harvest Idea" cards.

But you can create cards from ideas.
All you have to do is to draw an Idea card from an idea

 * Given a new example.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Draw a card from the "Harvest Idea" idea.

And now you should have an idea card.

 * There should be 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.

### Ideas are several cards

Ideas are not exclusive. 
That means that you can draw several times 
cards from the idea.
So if we draw one more card...

 * Given a new example.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Draw a card from the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Draw a card from the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * There should be 2 "Harvest Idea" cards.

Bingo, we have two cards of the same ideas.

### Removing idea cards

You can discard idea cards at any time.
Just return the card to the idea.

 * Given a new example.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Draw a card from the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Discard 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * There should be 0 "Harvest Idea" cards.

### Using ideas

But ideas are useless if you cannot use them
So, let's try to use an idea.

### Reading the idea

Ideas have instructions for what they need. Let's look closer to the "Harvest Idea" idea.

 * Given a new example.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * The "Harvest Idea" idea should require 1 card with at least 1 in "Fruit Plant" tag.
 * The "Harvest Idea" idea should require 1 card with at least 1 in "Worker" tag.

So, it says that it needs cards with a total of 1 "Fruit Plant", and 1 "Worker" tags.

So, let's see what we have:

 * Given a new example.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * Given there are 1 "Villager" cards.
 * The "Berry Bush" card should have 1 in "Fruit Plant" tag.
 * The "Villager" card should have 1 in "Worker" tag.

In addition, we can see that cards have description,
if we look to the description of the "Berry Bush", it would
say that the fruit is the "Berry".

 * Given a new example.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * The "Berry Bush" card description should say "Fruit" is "Berry". 

So we know that with a "Berry Bush", that is a "Fruit Plant", and a "Villager",
that is a "Worker", we will have the "Berry" card.

## Stacking cards

To use an idea we need an idea card, and then, place the required cards on top.
It says that it needs 1 "Villager" and 1 "Fruit Plant", so, we need:

 * Given a new example.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * Given there are 1 "Villager" cards.
 * Given there are 0 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * Draw a card from the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Move the "Harvest Idea" card to its own stack.
 * Move the "Villager" card on top of the "Harvest Idea" card.
 * Move the "Berry Bush" card on top of the "Villager" card.
 * There should be 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Berry Bush" cards.

### Trying ideas

Ideas are placed, and cards stacked, but nothing happens. 
That is because we are in the planning phase, changes actually happens
at the end of the moon. So, once we have the stack, we should end the moon and see what happens.

 * Given a new example.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 2 "Berry" cards.
 * There should be 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", 1 "Berry Bush", and 2 "Berry" cards.

So we have one new berries. But wait, did the villager eat its food? Yes!
So in fact harvest gets two berries, and both are on top of the stack that produced it.

### Order has some importance

What is important, is that all three cards are together, so, if we change the order,
it should work.

 * Given a new example.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Berry Bush", and 1 "Villager" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 2 "Berry" cards.

Unless, the idea is not the bottom card. Then it does not work.

 * Given a new example.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Berry Bush", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 0 "Berry" cards.

### Using ideas multiple times

The ides can be used several times, so:

 * Given a new example.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", 1 "Berry Bush", and 2 "Berry" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", 1 "Berry Bush", and 3 "Berry" cards.

So, after two moons, we have accumulated 2 more berries.

### Using the same idea twice

Because we can draw twice an idea, we can create two stacks. So:

 * Given a new example.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 2 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 2 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 2 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", 1 "Berry Bush", and 2 "Berry" cards.

We had two villagers eating, so they eat 2 berries, but they produced four berries,
two new berries for each villager.

### Eating comes first

Well, villagers are eager workers, but they need to eat first.
So, if you do not have food enough, but you have a bush, you can always get food for them.

 * Given a new example.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 0 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Corpse", 1 "Berry Bush", and 0 "Berry" cards.

So the villager died and all he left was a corpse.

### Card Substitutes

Ok, we know that "Villager" can harvest, but it makes reasonable that other cards
may be also likely to harvest, like "Militia" (eats two berries):

 * Given a new example.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 2 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Militia", and 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 2 "Berry" cards.

So "Militia" works like "Villager". And what about other cards? What about
"Apple Tree"?

 * Given a new example.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Apple" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Apple Tree" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", 1 "Apple Tree", and 2 "Apple" cards.
 * The "Apple Tree" card description should say "Fruit" is "Apple".

What? An Apple? Yes! Apple trees do Apples, not Berries.
And what about mixing them all?

 * Given a new example.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Apple" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Militia", and 1 "Apple Tree" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 2 "Apple" cards.

### More cards than necessary

What if we add more cards than necessary?

 * Given a new example.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Corpse", 1 "Berry Bush", and 1 "Villager" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 0 "Berry" cards.

It did not work. Stacks need to have the exact cards required for the idea.
Even if we have more cards than necessary of one kind:

 * Given a new example.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", and 2 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", 2 "Berry Bush", and 2 "Berry" cards.

It did work, because the first three cards are the ones expected.
And if we mix different Fruit Plants.

 * Given a new example.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Berry Bush", 1 "Apple Tree" and 1 "Villager" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 0 "Berry" cards.

Did not work because the first three cards does not contain a Worker. But,

 * Given a new example.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", 1 "Berry Bush" and 1 "Apple Tree" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 2 "Berry" cards.
 * There should be 0 "Apple" cards.

It worked, and it generated berries, because the "Berry Bush" card is between the three first cards.
And:

 * Given a new example.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", 1 "Apple Tree" and 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 0 "Berry" cards.
 * There should be 2 "Apple" cards.

It worked, and it generated apples, because the "Apple Tree" card is between the three first cards.
