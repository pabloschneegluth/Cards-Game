Wolfs may call another wolves. 
If they do that, they can attack and do more damage

 * Given a new game with a stack of 1 "Woods Stroll Idea" cards, 1 "Villager" cards, 1 "Wolf" cards
 * The wolf may create another "Wolf" card
 * Given that the odds are that we will get a "Wolf" from the "Woods Stroll Idea" card.
 * End the current moon
 * There should be 1 stacks of 1 "Woods Stroll Idea" cards, 1 "Villager" cards, 2 "Wolf" cards
